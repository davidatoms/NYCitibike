Columbia Data Analytics Module 14 - Using Tableau, this project will present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company.
Note: The dataset used for this project is available on https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html - I just had to 
place that folder in the gitignore file to keep my repository light and clean.

## What I Learned/Achieved:
- How to import data into Tableau.
- How to create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
- How to use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
- How to portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.
